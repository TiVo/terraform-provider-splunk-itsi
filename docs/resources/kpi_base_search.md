# itsi_kpi_base_search (Resource)

Manages a KPI Base search within ITSI.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "itsi_kpi_base_search" "my_kpi_base_search" {
  title                         = "this_is_a_test"
  actions                       = ""
  alert_lag                     = "31"
  alert_period                  = "5"
  base_search                   = "index=_internal source=*metrics.log group=tcpin_connections \n | eval sourceHost=if(isnull(hostname), sourceHost,hostname)"
  description                   = "This is a description for a KPI base search"
  entity_alias_filtering_fields = null

## Schema

### Required

- `alert_lag` (String) Contains the number of seconds of lag to apply to the alert search, max is 30 minutes (1799 seconds).
- `alert_period` (String) User specified interval to run the KPI search in minutes.
- `base_search` (String) KPI search defined by user for this KPI. All generated searches for the KPI are based on this search.
- `entity_breakdown_id_fields` (String) KPI search events are split by the alias field defined in entities for the service containing this KPI
- `entity_id_fields` (String) Fields from this KPI's search events that will be mapped to the alias fields defined in entities for the service containing this KPI. This field enables the KPI search to tie the aliases of entities to the fields from the KPI events in identifying entities at search time.
- `is_entity_breakdown` (Boolean) Determines if search breaks down by entities. See KPI definition.
- `is_service_entity_filter` (Boolean) If true a filter is used on the search based on the entities included in the service.
- `metrics` (Block Set, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--metrics))
- `search_alert_earliest` (String) Value in minutes. This determines how far back each time window is during KPI search runs.
- `sec_grp` (String) The team the object belongs to.
- `source_itsi_da` (String) Source of DA used for this search. See KPI Threshold Templates.
- `title` (String) Name of this KPI base search.

### Optional

- `actions` (String) Set of strings, delimited by comma. Corresponds custom actions stanzas, defined in alert_actions.conf. Defaults to ``.
- `description` (String) General description for this KPI base search.
- `entity_alias_filtering_fields` (String) Fields from this KPI's search events that will be mapped to the alias fields defined in entities for the service containing this KPI. This field enables the KPI search to tie the aliases of entities to the fields from the KPI events in identifying entities at search time.
- `metric_qualifier` (String) Used to further split metrics. Hidden in the UI.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--metrics"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metrics`

Required:

- `aggregate_statop` (String) Statistical operation (avg, max, median, stdev, and so on) used to combine data for the aggregate alert_value (used for all KPI).
- `entity_statop` (String) Statistical operation (avg, max, mean, and so on) used to combine data for alert_values on a per entity basis (used if entity_breakdown is true).
- `fill_gaps` (String) How to fill missing data
- `threshold_field` (String) The field on which the statistical operation runs
- `title` (String) Name of this metric
- `unit` (String) User-defined units for the values in threshold field.

Optional:

- `gap_custom_alert_value` (Number) Custom value to fill data gaps. Defaults to `0`.
- `gap_severity` (String) Severity level assigned for data gaps (info, normal, low, medium, high, critical, or unknown). Defaults to `unknown`.
- `gap_severity_color` (String) Severity color assigned for data gaps. Defaults to `#CCCCCC`.
- `gap_severity_color_light` (String) Severity light color assigned for data gaps. Defaults to `#EEEEEE`.
- `gap_severity_value` (String) Severity value assigned for data gaps. Defaults to `-1`.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Generated metric _key
