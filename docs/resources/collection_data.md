- `entry` (Block Set) Block representing an entry in the collection (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--entry))
- `scope` (String) Scope of the collection data
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `generation` (Number) Computed latest generation of changes
- `id` (String) Computed instance ID of the resource, used w/ 'generation' to prevent row duplication in a given scope

<a id="nestedblock--collection"></a>
### Nested Schema for `collection`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the collection

Optional:

- `app` (String) App of the collection. Defaults to 'itsi'.
- `owner` (String) Owner of the collection. Defaults to 'nobody'.


<a id="nestedblock--entry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `entry`

Required:

- `data` (String) Collection entry `data` must be JSON encoded map where keys are field names, and values are strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays of those types.

Optional:

- `id` (String) _key for the collection entry


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import itsi_collection_data.example {{owner}}/{{app}}/{{name}}:{{scope}}
OR
terraform import itsi_collection_data.example {{app}}/{{name}}:{{scope}}
#OR
terraform import itsi_collection_data.example {{name}}:{{scope}}
#OR
terraform import itsi_collection_data.example {{name}}

# NOTE:
# When the collection's owner and/or app are not provided, the default values of "nobody" and "itsi" are assumed respectively.
# When scope is ommited, the "default" scope is assumed.
```
