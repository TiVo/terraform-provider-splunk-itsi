    EOT

    earliest_time = "-10m"
  }

  search {
    query = <<-EOT
      | makeresults count=5 | eval test = "B"

- `earliest_time` (String) Specify a time string. Sets the earliest (inclusive), respectively, time bounds for the search.
- `latest_time` (String) Specify a time string. Sets the latest (exclusive), respectively, time bounds for the search.
- `splunk_app` (String) The Splunk app in which the search query should be performed.
- `splunk_user` (String) The Splunk user in the context of which the search query should be performed
